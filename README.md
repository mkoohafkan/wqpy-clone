# wqpy - Water Quality Portal querying and data retrieval

Retrieve environmental sensor data from the California State Department
of Water Resources, Division of Environmental Services Water Quality
Portal via the Telemetry Direct Web Services API. 

This is a clone of a module I developed while working for the
California Department of Water Resources. Sensitive information
and development history have been removed but I have kept the
underlying infrastructure as a learning tool/reference/example.
**This module is not functional** because proprietary information
has been removed. Maybe someday I'll make a mock server so that this
module can function as a demo... someday...
